# Contributing to Dimension Trade

**"Speed is the only edge left."**

We are building the fastest, most effective tool for capturing value in the meme economy. We welcome those who want to sharpen that edge.

## Core Philosophy

1.  **Speed > Perfection**: Ship it. If it works and it's fast, it's good.
2.  **Privacy First**: No tracking, no leaky abstractions. The user owns their keys and their data.
3.  **Aesthetics Matter**: The tool should feel powerful. Cyberpunk, dark mode, high density.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find a Mission
Check the [Issues](https://github.com/your-org/dimension-trade/issues) tab. Look for "Good First Issue" or "Help Wanted". Or just build something cool you want to see.

### 2. Fork & Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dimension-trade.git

### 3. Branch
Naming convention: `type/description`

- `fix/rpc-connection`
- `ui/darker-mode`

### 4. Commit
We use conventional commits.
- `feat: add shadow routing`
- `fix: resolve pump portal timeout`

### 5. Push & PR
Open a Pull Request against `main`. Describe what you built and why it gives us an edge.

## Development Tips

- **Mock Mode**: Use `AI_PROVIDER="mock"` in `.env` to save credits while testing UI flows.
- **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint` before pushing.
