## 1. The Mission

The memecoin supercycle isn't a bubble—it's a democratization of venture capital. But retail traders are fighting with dull knives against snipers, bots, and insiders.

**DexDrip** exists to weaponize the retail trader. We build professional-grade, "local-first" tools that automate the creative and technical friction of launching and trading, letting you focus on the only thing that matters: **Speed.**

## 2. The Problem

1.  **Creative Friction:** Launching a token requires Art, a Banner, a PFP, and a vibe. This takes 20-30 minutes manually. In crypto, 20 minutes is a lifetime.
2.  **Technical Friction:** navigating pump.fun, managing wallets, ensuring safety.
3.  **Information Asymmetry:** Insiders know the meta before you do.

## 3. The Solution: DexDrip Terminal

DexDrip is an AI-native trading terminal that collapses the "Idea -> Launch" loop to under 30 seconds.

-   **Tweet Sniper:** Paste a viral tweet -> receive a fully generated Brand (Ticker, Name, Art, Website).
-   **One-Click Launch:** Deploy instantly to Pump.fun via optimized RPC routes.
-   **Shadow Routing:** Your trades are local. Your keys are local. No server sees your private key.

## 4. $DRIP Tokenomics

$DRIP is not a governance token. It is a **License Key**.

### Utility
The DexDrip terminal has two tiers:

| Feature | Free Tier | **Pro Tier ($DRIP Holder)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manual Art Studio** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Pump.fun Launcher** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Tweet Sniper (AI)** | ❌ No | **✅ UNLOCKED** |
| **Shadow Bundles** | ❌ No | **✅ UNLOCKED** (Coming Q1) |
| **RPC Priority** | ❌ Standard | **✅ Turbo** (Coming Q1) |

**Requirement:** Hold **1,000,000 $DRIP** in your connected wallet to access Pro features.

### Supply
-   **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion)
-   **Tax:** 0/0
-   **Liquidity:** Burned.

## 5. Roadmap

-   **Phase 1 (Now):** Launch Terminal V1. Tweet Sniper + Art Engine.
-   **Phase 2 (Q1 2026):** "Shadow Bundles" - launch on multiple wallets simultaneously to mimic organic volume.
-   **Phase 3 (Q2 2026):** Mobile App (iOS/Android) with push notifications for "Sniper Alerts".
